This project is a minimal fullstack demo created for my SAP interview.  
It includes:
- **Frontend**: React app with SAP-themed UI and live timer  
- **Backend**: Express API with sample endpoints  
- **CI/CD**:
  - Frontend: Auto-build & deploy to GitHub Pages on push to `main`  
  - Backend: Smoke tests to ensure server boots & endpoints respond
